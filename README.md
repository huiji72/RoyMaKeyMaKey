[Roy] Makey Makey

This is a modified version of the MaKeyMaKey sketch, intended to 
operate 6 different servos at once. The servos tested with this are HXT900,
and the hand kit came from www.roytherobot.com.

INSTRUCTIONS
===
Import the **firmware/hardware/MaKeyMaKey** folder into the 
**hardware** folder of your Arduino sketchbook folder. Then restart and 
enable the **MaKey Makey** option in the Tools > Board menu of Arduino.

CALIBRATION
===
There's a simple **calibrate_roy** sketch to help you tune the servo ranges,
which you can then change in **roy_makey_makey/settings.h**
